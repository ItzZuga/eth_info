Ethereum Price Information script for Sinusbot.

It fetches the price in EUR in the selected channel from the GDAX Public API. There's an option for the interval as well as (obviously) for the channel. It can easily be used For BTC or USD just by replacing the four "EUR" entries by the desired currency.

Install it by just droping it into your "scripts" folder inside your sinusbot instalation and restarting the sinusbot instance.
